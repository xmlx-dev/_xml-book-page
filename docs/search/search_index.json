Using Creative Commons Public Licenses Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses. Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material. 3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply. Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a.

If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. ======================================================================= Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

GitHub Workflow \u00b6 Please use GitHub Issues to report problems pertaining to this repository. Choose one of the pre-defined issue templates; it will guide you through the reporting process. We have templates for problems with: the book content, technical infrastructure of the book, technical aspects and content of the documentation, and technical infrastructure of the repository. Prior to opening an issue, make sure that the reported problem is not already covered by one of the existing issues . If you would like to discuss the problem before opening an issue, you can use our GitHub Discussion board or get in touch via any other suitable communication channel . If you wish to contribute to the project, you must open an issue first to discuss the envisaged changes and additions. This procedure is in place to ensure that work is not duplicated and that the proposed changes will make it into the book release (otherwise we cannot guarantee accepting your contributions). Also, once the outline of the contribution is agreed, other people can more easily join in to help with the development and make the most out of everybody\u2019s time commitment. Furthermore, this workflow allows us to maintain excellent quality of the content, its factual correctness and adherence to our book and documentation contribution guidelines. Any contributions should be submitted as GitHub Pull Requests against the dev branch of the xmlx-dev/xml-book repository from your personal fork of the codebase \u2013 see the following sections for more details. To get an inspiration for a contribution, have a look at our work plan by navigating to GitHub Projects , where we maintain a simple kanban -esque board. Development Environment Setup \u00b6 Most of the tools and workflows utilised by this project are written in Python. Consider using Python virtual environments (e.g., pyenv with pyenv-virtualenv ) for setting up your development environment. Code Repository \u00b6 You should start by forking the xmlx-dev/xml-book GitHub repository. Next, clone it onto your local machine and enter the source directory git clone git@github.com:<your GitHub user ID>/xml-book.git cd xml-book Then, move to the dev branch, and create a new branch for your contributions git checkout dev git checkout -b my-contribution-branch It is important that you branch off dev , as this source tree holds the latest version of the book (which may have not necessarily been released yet). Consider setting up pre-commit git hooks to ensure that your individual contributions are consistent with our quality standards. When you are done with your contributions, open a GitHub Pull Request from the feature branch in your fork ( my-contribution-branch ) onto the dev branch in the main repository ( xmlx-dev/xml-book ). Building the Documentation \u00b6 To build the documentation, you need to have relevant Python packages installed. You can do this with pip install -r requirements-docs.txt Then, you can start a local live documentation server that automatically reloads upon detecting any changes to the source tree by executing mkdocs serve from the root of this repository. Alternatively, you can build the documentation website with mkdocs build -s -d ./_build/docs and browse through the resulting HTML files, which are placed in the ./_build/docs directory. Building the Book \u00b6 To build the book, you need to have relevant Python packages installed. You can do this with pip install -r requirements-book.txt You can then build the book website with jb build -nW ./ and browse through the resulting HTML files, which are placed in the ./_build/html directory. Alternatively, you may serve the book website with the builtin Python HTTP server, like so python -m http.server ./_build/html XML Book Code In addition to popular Python libraries, the book is supported by a bespoke library ( xmlx-dev/xml-book-code ) that implements functionality streamlining content creation. For more information see the Execution Environment Settings section below. Automation \u00b6 To help automate and streamline some development tasks, the repository is shipped with a collection of helper functions. These require some relevant Python packages to be installed on your system pip install -r requirements-tools.txt in addition to having the aspell spell-checking software installed (the following command is for Ubuntu Linux) apt-get install -y aspell aspell-en (Use a package manager relevant to your operating system to install aspell , e.g., brew install aspell for MacOS.) These functions are invoked through the ./tools/fn.sh Bash scrip with ./tools/fn.sh <function_name> e.g., ./tools/fn.sh check_spelling . Installing Pre-Commit Git Hooks \u00b6 Pre-commit git hooks are scripts executed before every commit; if any of them fails, you will not be allowed to commit your changes. This quality-checking system helps you to maintain high standards of your contributions along the way, thus saving you from fixing all of the small errors when opening a pull request. To set them up execute ./tools/fn.sh setup_git_hooks To disable pre-commit hooks, comment out relevant lines in the .git/hooks/pre-commit file. If you want to commit changes without running pre-commit hooks, add the -n flag ( --no-verify ) to your git commit command. (Make sure that you do not abuse this flag as side-stepping pre-commit checks can lead to a build-up of errors that will need to be fixed prior to merging your changes.) Checking Cleanliness of Jupyter Notebooks \u00b6 Since our book environment ( Jupyter Book ) supports content written in (MyST) Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks (among many others formats ), we need to ensure that the source files are clean. This is particularly important for Jupyter Notebook, which may contain cell execution artefacts (output) and metadata. To maintain a small footprint of the book source and avoid unexpected build errors, Jupyter Notebooks committed to the repository should be clean. You can check the status of your notebooks with the following command (which is also executed as one of the pre-commit hooks) ./tools/fn.sh check_clean_ipynb If necessary, you can clean your notebooks with ./tools/fn.sh clean_ipynb Note that the notebooks are cleaned in-place so you will not be able to restore discarded output cells and metadata. Spell-Checking \u00b6 Given the textual nature of the project, it is important to ensure a correct and consistent spelling throughout. We achieve this with PySpelling \u2013 a Python automation framework built around aspell . You can check the spelling of all the relevant project files like so ./tools/fn.sh check_spelling (which is also one of the pre-commit hooks). If you find that a certain word is missing from the spell-check dictionary, you can extend it by placing the word in question in the tools/pyspelling_en_GB-custom.txt file. This list of words must be sorted alphanumerically (case insensitive) and it extends the standard British English dictionary. Checking Wording of the Book \u00b6 We also have a list of words that should be avoided as well as preferred spelling for certain words and phrases, e.g., \u201cdata set\u201d instead of \u201cdataset\u201d. You can check the book \u2013 both its source files and the built HTML tree \u2013 like so (which is also run as one of the pre-commit hooks) ./tools/fn.sh check_wording TThe list of words and substitutions is stored in the tools/wording.yml file. Checking for Leftover TODO Markers \u00b6 Additionally, you can check whether any file in the repository has a leftover, case-insensitive \u201ctodo\u201d keyword with the check_todos script. ./tools/fn.sh check_todos (This command is executed as one of the pre-commit hooks.) Validating Version and Year \u00b6 Since the version of the book is stored in multiple places, a custom script is used to ensure their consistency. The versions listed in the Jupyter Book and MkDocs configuration files are compared against the citation file and the latest entry in the changelog. The copyright year placed in both configuration files is also compared against the current year. These operations are executed with ./tools/get_book_version.py which \u2013 when everything is as expected \u2013 returns the book version. This script is run as one of the pre-commit and pre-push hooks, ensuring that the commit tag, if any, agrees with to the book version and that the versioning is consistent. (Similar checks are run by GitHub when publishing a new release of the book.) Build Aliases \u00b6 The ./tools/fn.sh Bash script also implements a collection of shortcuts for common build tasks: build_book builds the book, linkcheck_book checks whether all of the links placed in the book are accessible, build_docs builds the documentation, link_docs integrates the documentation build (static HTML website) into the book build (by copying the _build/docs directory into the _build/html/ directory), build builds the book and the documentation, and links the two. XML Book Python Package \u00b6 The book is accompanied by the bespoke xml_book Python module, whose implementation can be found in the xmlx-dev/xml-book-code GitHub repository. It should be imported along with other needed packages at the top of each book file in a dedicated code cell tagged with remove-cell to hide it in the rendered document. (The example below is for files in the MyST Markdown format.) ```{code-cell} python --- tags: [remove-cell] --- import xml_book ``` If you need to extend the package while working on the book, you can clone the code repository into a folder named _code , which is ignored by git and excluded from Jupyter Book builds. git clone git@github.com:xmlx-dev/xml-book-code.git _code Then install the package as an editable source pip install -e _code which allows you to work on the code without the need to manually update the package installation every time a change is made. Execution Environment Settings \u00b6 Importantly, the XML-Book-Code package allows to apply consistent settings to each page of the book. The xml_book.config module implements various environment setup functions, which are then invoked from the initialisation file \u2013 xml_book/__init__.py \u2013 of the xml_book library. For example, to unify the look of plots, the xml_book.config.setup_plotting function is executed automatically upon package import, ensuring that the figures are in the seaborn style and rendered as SVGs. To apply the settings defined by the xml_book module, it needs to be imported on each individual page that makes use of programmatically generated content. Setting Up Python Environment To load global settings of the Python environment used to generate book content through execution of Python scripts, load the xml_book module. To this end, insert a hidden code cell into your MyST Markdown content file. ```{code-cell} python --- tags: [remove-cell] --- import xml_book ``` Known Issues \u00b6 There are some known issues with the software stack used for generating the book, which either prevent using certain functionality or require a workaround. It is impossible to specify global settings of the iPython environment (e.g., c.InlineBackend.figure_formats = {'svg'} ) used to execute Python code in parts of the book that make use of programmatically-generated content \u2013 see this GitHub issue . The workaround is applied by configuring the execution environment from within the custom XML-Book-Code Python package. The MyST-NB package responsible for executing Python code included in MyST Markdown content files has a bug that does not allow to include more than two Python-generated figures in a single file if more than one of them has an ID assigned with the name parameter. ```{code-cell} python --- render: image: width: 300px alt: Figure description. figure: caption: | Figure caption. name: 'fig:reference:id' ``` See these two GitHub issues: (1) , (2) . Dropdown admonitions take too much space when collapsed if a table is placed inside.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright.

If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees ======================================================================= Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 -- Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License. d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike. h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. k. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange. l. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 -- Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply. c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes. Section 3 -- License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. b. ShareAlike. In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply. 1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License. 2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material. 3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply. Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 -- Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. ======================================================================= Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Definitions. \u201cYou\u201d (or \u201cYour\u201d) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorised by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with XMLX. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. \u201cContribution\u201d shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to XMLX for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by XMLX (the \u201cWork\u201d).

Choose one of the pre-defined issue templates; it will guide you through the reporting process. We have templates for problems with: the book content, technical infrastructure of the book, technical aspects and content of the documentation, and technical infrastructure of the repository. Prior to opening an issue, make sure that the reported problem is not already covered by one of the existing issues . If you would like to discuss the problem before opening an issue, you can use our GitHub Discussion board or get in touch via any other suitable communication channel . If you wish to contribute to the project, you must open an issue first to discuss the envisaged changes and additions. This procedure is in place to ensure that work is not duplicated and that the proposed changes will make it into the book release (otherwise we cannot guarantee accepting your contributions). Also, once the outline of the contribution is agreed, other people can more easily join in to help with the development and make the most out of everybody\u2019s time commitment. Furthermore, this workflow allows us to maintain excellent quality of the content, its factual correctness and adherence to our book and documentation contribution guidelines. Any contributions should be submitted as GitHub Pull Requests against the dev branch of the xmlx-dev/xml-book repository from your personal fork of the codebase \u2013 see the following sections for more details. To get an inspiration for a contribution, have a look at our work plan by navigating to GitHub Projects , where we maintain a simple kanban -esque board.","title":"GitHub Workflow"},{"location":"dev/#development-environment-setup","text":"Most of the tools and workflows utilised by this project are written in Python.

Next, clone it onto your local machine and enter the source directory git clone git@github.com:<your GitHub user ID>/xml-book.git cd xml-book Then, move to the dev branch, and create a new branch for your contributions git checkout dev git checkout -b my-contribution-branch It is important that you branch off dev , as this source tree holds the latest version of the book (which may have not necessarily been released yet). Consider setting up pre-commit git hooks to ensure that your individual contributions are consistent with our quality standards. When you are done with your contributions, open a GitHub Pull Request from the feature branch in your fork ( my-contribution-branch ) onto the dev branch in the main repository ( xmlx-dev/xml-book ).","title":"Code Repository"},{"location":"dev/#building-the-documentation","text":"To build the documentation, you need to have relevant Python packages installed. You can do this with pip install -r requirements-docs.txt Then, you can start a local live documentation server that automatically reloads upon detecting any changes to the source tree by executing mkdocs serve from the root of this repository.

These require some relevant Python packages to be installed on your system pip install -r requirements-tools.txt in addition to having the aspell spell-checking software installed (the following command is for Ubuntu Linux) apt-get install -y aspell aspell-en (Use a package manager relevant to your operating system to install aspell , e.g., brew install aspell for MacOS.) These functions are invoked through the ./tools/fn.sh Bash scrip with ./tools/fn.sh <function_name> e.g., ./tools/fn.sh check_spelling .","title":"Automation"},{"location":"dev/#installing-pre-commit-git-hooks","text":"Pre-commit git hooks are scripts executed before every commit; if any of them fails, you will not be allowed to commit your changes. This quality-checking system helps you to maintain high standards of your contributions along the way, thus saving you from fixing all of the small errors when opening a pull request. To set them up execute ./tools/fn.sh setup_git_hooks To disable pre-commit hooks, comment out relevant lines in the .git/hooks/pre-commit file. If you want to commit changes without running pre-commit hooks, add the -n flag ( --no-verify ) to your git commit command. (Make sure that you do not abuse this flag as side-stepping pre-commit checks can lead to a build-up of errors that will need to be fixed prior to merging your changes.)","title":"Installing Pre-Commit Git Hooks"},{"location":"dev/#checking-cleanliness-of-jupyter-notebooks","text":"Since our book environment ( Jupyter Book ) supports content written in (MyST) Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks (among many others formats ), we need to ensure that the source files are clean. This is particularly important for Jupyter Notebook, which may contain cell execution artefacts (output) and metadata. To maintain a small footprint of the book source and avoid unexpected build errors, Jupyter Notebooks committed to the repository should be clean. You can check the status of your notebooks with the following command (which is also executed as one of the pre-commit hooks) ./tools/fn.sh check_clean_ipynb If necessary, you can clean your notebooks with ./tools/fn.sh clean_ipynb Note that the notebooks are cleaned in-place so you will not be able to restore discarded output cells and metadata.","title":"Checking Cleanliness of Jupyter Notebooks"},{"location":"dev/#spell-checking","text":"Given the textual nature of the project, it is important to ensure a correct and consistent spelling throughout. We achieve this with PySpelling \u2013 a Python automation framework built around aspell . You can check the spelling of all the relevant project files like so ./tools/fn.sh check_spelling (which is also one of the pre-commit hooks). If you find that a certain word is missing from the spell-check dictionary, you can extend it by placing the word in question in the tools/pyspelling_en_GB-custom.txt file. This list of words must be sorted alphanumerically (case insensitive) and it extends the standard British English dictionary.","title":"Spell-Checking"},{"location":"dev/#checking-wording-of-the-book","text":"We also have a list of words that should be avoided as well as preferred spelling for certain words and phrases, e.g., \u201cdata set\u201d instead of \u201cdataset\u201d.

The versions listed in the Jupyter Book and MkDocs configuration files are compared against the citation file and the latest entry in the changelog. The copyright year placed in both configuration files is also compared against the current year. These operations are executed with ./tools/get_book_version.py which \u2013 when everything is as expected \u2013 returns the book version. This script is run as one of the pre-commit and pre-push hooks, ensuring that the commit tag, if any, agrees with to the book version and that the versioning is consistent. (Similar checks are run by GitHub when publishing a new release of the book.)","title":"Validating Version and Year"},{"location":"dev/#build-aliases","text":"The ./tools/fn.sh Bash script also implements a collection of shortcuts for common build tasks: build_book builds the book, linkcheck_book checks whether all of the links placed in the book are accessible, build_docs builds the documentation, link_docs integrates the documentation build (static HTML website) into the book build (by copying the _build/docs directory into the _build/html/ directory), build builds the book and the documentation, and links the two.","title":"Build Aliases"},{"location":"dev/#xml-book-python-package","text":"The book is accompanied by the bespoke xml_book Python module, whose implementation can be found in the xmlx-dev/xml-book-code GitHub repository.

(The example below is for files in the MyST Markdown format.) ```{code-cell} python --- tags: [remove-cell] --- import xml_book ``` If you need to extend the package while working on the book, you can clone the code repository into a folder named _code , which is ignored by git and excluded from Jupyter Book builds. git clone git@github.com:xmlx-dev/xml-book-code.git _code Then install the package as an editable source pip install -e _code which allows you to work on the code without the need to manually update the package installation every time a change is made.","title":"XML Book Python Package"},{"location":"dev/#execution-environment-settings","text":"Importantly, the XML-Book-Code package allows to apply consistent settings to each page of the book. The xml_book.config module implements various environment setup functions, which are then invoked from the initialisation file \u2013 xml_book/__init__.py \u2013 of the xml_book library. For example, to unify the look of plots, the xml_book.config.setup_plotting function is executed automatically upon package import, ensuring that the figures are in the seaborn style and rendered as SVGs. To apply the settings defined by the xml_book module, it needs to be imported on each individual page that makes use of programmatically generated content. Setting Up Python Environment To load global settings of the Python environment used to generate book content through execution of Python scripts, load the xml_book module. To this end, insert a hidden code cell into your MyST Markdown content file. ```{code-cell} python --- tags: [remove-cell] --- import xml_book ```","title":"Execution Environment Settings"},{"location":"dev/#known-issues","text":"There are some known issues with the software stack used for generating the book, which either prevent using certain functionality or require a workaround. It is impossible to specify global settings of the iPython environment (e.g., c.InlineBackend.figure_formats = {'svg'} ) used to execute Python code in parts of the book that make use of programmatically-generated content \u2013 see this GitHub issue . The workaround is applied by configuring the execution environment from within the custom XML-Book-Code Python package. The MyST-NB package responsible for executing Python code included in MyST Markdown content files has a bug that does not allow to include more than two Python-generated figures in a single file if more than one of them has an ID assigned with the name parameter. ```{code-cell} python --- render: image: width: 300px alt: Figure description. figure: caption: | Figure caption. name: 'fig:reference:id' ``` See these two GitHub issues: (1) , (2) .
